- [Rozuvan Circles Fractal [part 2]](https://valera-rozuvan.github.io/rozuvan-jupyter-notebooks/rozuvan_circles_fractal_part_2.html)

NOTE: These live samples were created by first exporting as HTML and then crafting a bit the generated HTML file to suit my needs. Need to come up with an easier way to do an export to the web. Maybe nowadays this is easier?
